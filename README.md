# Streamlined Farmer

A Python script for Windows that controls your keypresses in the Roblox train simulator [Streamlined](https://www.roblox.com/games/1788251222/) so that you can farm for Gulden and levels. This was specifically made and timed for the **NS 4500** train from **Zand op 't Zee** to **Hazeldrecht** with seven third class C8c wagons, so it's completely beginner friendly!

### Prerequisites:

Python 3: https://www.python.org/

Once you've [added the Python executable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-add-python-to-windows-path/) to your PATH variable (this is the hard part), open a command prompt or Powershell and enter this command to install the `pydirectinput` library needed for keypresses.
```
pip install pydirectinput
```

If you want to use a **different train with different carts, and a different route**, then change the time values (in seconds) inside the Python script, or copy some lines around and make your own! 

Download the [main.py](main.py) script. Spawn your train and the carts using the particular route. Run the script using Python, or use the command `python main.py`, and go back to Roblox as fast as possible, because the script will start running in 5 seconds! 

Happy farming!
